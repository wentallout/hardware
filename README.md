## GPU

### GPU Power limit

Look at the `W` number in GPU Subsystem power. More W = more power/FPS even with the same GPU.

### VRAM

6GB VRAM is not bad.

### Boost FPS with DLSS, FSR, XeSS

Nice performance boost in games. AMD only get you FSR.

### Good choice?

RTX 3060, Radeon 6600m: Good
RTX 3070: Excellent performance
3080: too expensive
RTX 4080: also too expensive. RTX 4070 might not be worth it?

3060RTX laptops are all you need for 1080p gaming.
3060RTX 130W GPUs beat 3070RTX 115W GPUs.
3070RTX 140W are better than 3080RTX GPUs running at 115W.
3080RTX are only a good purchase past 115W.

## CPU
The processor (or CPU) is the brain of your computer. The GPU starts to matter more when gaming at higher resolutions, particularly at 1440p and above. Some games depend more on the CPU than GPU, it varies based on the resolution, settings and game engine. Look for a laptop with a high-performance processor, such as an Intel Core i5/i7 or an AMD Ryzen 5/7 from the last 1-3 years. These processors will provide plenty of power for even the most demanding games.


in 2022, we reach 8 core 16/24 threads. More core/threads = run more things at the same time.

### How to check CPU health?

For Intel: try Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool


### CPU Power Limit

Never listed on the spec. Check laptop reviews. More cores need more power to run.

### Good choices

- i9 is not worth it
- i5 and ryzen 5 are decent
- ryzen 7 is sweet spot
- Ryzen 5000 series are decent
- AMD Ryzen 5 6600H
- AMD Ryzen 7 6800H
- Intel 12700H is better than 6800H

## RAM

16GB with dual channel (it means 2 sticks)
with new DDR5, it doesn't matter if you have dual channel or not

## Storage
You’ll want a laptop with a solid-state drive (SSD) that is at least 512GB, but 1TB is preferable. With the size of games these days, it’s really not worth getting anything smaller. A laptop with a spare M.2 slot for an extra SSD upgrade in future would also be nice to have.

Most comes with 256GB SSD
AT least 512GB is the minimum
1TB is recommended
Most have M.2 slot with support for fast PCIE gen3 and VME SSD.
If they only have one slot then it might be a red flag.
2022 laptops might support new PCIE Gen 4 standard. Gen 5 might be too much?

DO NOT BUY HARD DRIVES, only SSD is good.

## Size and Weight

If you plan on taking your gaming laptop with you on the go, you’ll want to pay attention to the size and weight. Laptops with 15-inch or 17-inch displays are the most popular for gaming, though 16 and 18-inch are becoming more popular in 2023. If you’re looking for something more portable, consider a laptop with a 13-inch or 14-inch display, but you may want to plug in an external monitor for gaming. Keep in mind that powerful tech gets more expensive at smaller sizes!

13,14inch for portability but it's too small.
15inch is the sweet spot.
17inch for hardcore people?

## Resolution

High resolutions need more GPU power.

1080, 1440 is the most common
4K is not recommended

If you go 1440 => pick 17inch

16:9 is common.

## Screen refresh rate

https://jarrods.tech/does-connecting-a-monitor-to-gaming-laptop-increase-refresh-rate/

60Hz is the lowest. 120Hz are usually bad?
144Hz is usually better (but depends on panel)

For 1080p => the highest is 360Hz
For 1440p => 240Hz
4K => 144Hz

## Screen response time

How long it takes the screen to change colors from one to another

## Screen brightness and color

300 Nits at max brightness

400 is much better.

90-100percent srgb coverage

## Panel type

IPS is common.

TN is just bad.

OLED got better brightness but very expensive. OLED also has lower screen response time

## MUX Switch

If your laptop doesn't have MUX Switch, it's bad. That's it.
https://jarrods.tech/list-of-gaming-laptops-with-mux-switch/
Optimus Off is better

It it has G-sync then it should have MUX Switch.

Can be controlled through NVIDIA panel

## PORTS

Some laptops come with a lot of ports, and others come with much fewer. Think about the amount of USB-A and USB-C devices you might need to connect, as well as Ethernet and SD card slots. Even the position of the ports needs to be considered. Are they fine on the sides where your hands might sit, or would you prefer them on the back with cables out of the way?

Usually 3 USB ports with typeC

HDMI 2.1 which supports 4K MOnitor at 144Hz. ASUS for some reason stick to 2.0

## Battery

List of Laptop Battery Life: https://jarrods.tech/list-of-laptop-battery-life/
100WH is the max for laptop batteries. but it still depends on how power hungry the laptop is.

## Printer

Most printers... are scam, especially Inkjet printers. Epson Ecotank is not bad? cuz they hold a lot of ink. SOme people say lasers are good, need to investigate more.
