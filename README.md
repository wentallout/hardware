## GPU

### GPU Power limit

Look at the `W` number in GPU Subsystem power. More W = more power/FPS even with the same GPU.

### VRAM

6GB VRAM is not bad.

### Boost FPS with DLSS, FSR, XeSS

Nice performance boost in games. AMD only get you FSR.

### Good choice?

RTX 3060, Radeon 6600m: Good

RTX 3070: Excellent performance

3080: too expensive

RTX 4080: also too expensive. RTX 4070 might not be worth it?

## CPU

in 2022, we reach 8 core 16/24 threads. More core/threads = run more things at the same time.

### CPU Power Limit

Never listed on the spec. Check laptop reviews. More cores need more power to run.

### Good choices

- i9 is not worth it
- i5 and ryzen 5 are decent
- ryzen 7 is sweet spot
- Ryzen 5000 series are decent
- AMD Ryzen 5 6600H
- AMD Ryzen 7 6800H
- Intel 12700H is better than 6800H

## RAM

16GB with dual channel (it means 2 sticks)
with new DDR5, it doesn't matter if you have dual channel or not

## Storage

Most comes with 256GB SSD
AT least 512GB is the minimum
1TB is recommended
Most have M.2 slot with support for fast PCIE gen3 and VME SSD.
If they only have one slot then it might be a red flag.
2022 laptops might support new PCIE Gen 4 standard. Gen 5 might be too much?

DO NOT BUY HARD DRIVES, only SSD is good.

## Sized and Weight

13,14inch for portability but it's too small.
15inch is the sweet spot.
17inch for hardcore people?

## Resolution

High resolutions need more GPU power.

1080, 1440 is the most common
4K is not recommended

If you go 1440 => pick 17inch

16:9 is common.

## Screen refresh rate

60Hz is the lowest. 120Hz are usually bad?
144Hz is usually better (but depends on panel)

For 1080p => the highest is 360Hz
For 1440p => 240Hz
4K => 144Hz

## Screen response time

How long it takes the screen to change colors from one to another

## Screen brightness and color

300 Nits at max brightness

400 is much better.

90-100percent srgb coverage

## Panel type

IPS is common.

TN is just bad.

OLED got better brightness but very expensive. OLED also has lower screen response time

## MUX Switch

If your laptop doesn't have MUX Switch, it's bad. That's it.

Optimus Off is better

It it has G-sync then it should have MUX Switch.

Can be controlled through NVIDIA panel

## PORTS

Usually 3 USB ports with typeC

HDMI 2.1 which supports 4K MOnitor at 144Hz. ASUS for some reason stick to 2.0

## Battery

List of Laptop Battery Life: https://jarrods.tech/list-of-laptop-battery-life/
100WH is the max for laptop batteries. but it still depends on how power hungry the laptop is.

## OS

Windows or Linux. Most people will go Windows 11
